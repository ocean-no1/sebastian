Understanding Business Models
A business model is a high-level plan for profitably operating a business in a specific marketplace. <br>
A primary component of the business model is the value proposition. <br>
This is a description of the goods or services that a company offers and why they are desirable to customers or clients, 
ideally stated in a way that differentiates the product or service from its competitors.<br>

A new enterprise's business model should also cover projected startup costs and financing sources, 
the target customer base for the business, marketing strategy, a review of the competition, and projections of revenues and expenses.<br>
The plan may also define opportunities in which the business can partner with other established companies. <br>
For example, the business model for an advertising business may identify benefits from an arrangement for referrals to and from a printing company.<br>


Successful businesses have business models that allow them to fulfill client needs at a competitive price and a sustainable cost. Over time, 
many businesses revise their business models from time to time to reflect changing business environments and market demands.<br>
When evaluating a company as a possible investment, the investor should find out exactly how it makes its money. <br>
This means looking through the company's business model. Admittedly, the business model may not tell you everything about a company's prospects. <br>
But the investor who understands the business model can make better sense of the financial data.
